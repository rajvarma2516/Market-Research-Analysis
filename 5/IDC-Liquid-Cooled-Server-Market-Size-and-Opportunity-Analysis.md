This market is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 23% from 2023 to 2028. The adoption of liquid cooling technology in data centers is driven by the increasing demand for higher server densities and energy efficiency. The benefits of liquid cooling, including reduced power consumption and improved thermal management, are becoming increasingly recognized, leading to accelerated market growth. This growth is supported by ongoing advancements in cooling technologies and the expanding need for efficient heat dissipation in high-performance computing environments.</p><p>Emerging markets present substantial opportunities for the liquid cooled server sector. Regions such as Asia-Pacific and Latin America are expected to witness significant adoption due to rapid data center expansions and growing IT infrastructure investments. In these emerging markets, the shift towards liquid cooling is driven by the need to address challenges associated with traditional air cooling methods, including higher operational costs and limited cooling efficiency. As these regions continue to develop their technological capabilities and invest in modern data center solutions, they are likely to become key contributors to the global liquid cooled server market growth.</p></p><p class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Global IDC Liquid Cooled Server Report @ <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=490670&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=226" target="_blank">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=490670&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=226</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who are the largest Global manufacturers in the IDC Liquid Cooled Server industry?</h3><p><li>Inspur</li><li> Huawei</li><li> H3C</li><li> Sugon Dataenergy</li><li> Alibaba Cloud</li><li> Lenovo</li><li> Thomas-Krenn</li><li> IBM</li><li> Dell</li><li> Vertiv</li><li> Envicool</li><li> Fujitsu</li><li> Nettrix</li><li> Zhonguo Greatwall Technology</li><li> Wangsu Science&Technology</li></p><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><p>By the year 2030, the scale for growth in the market research industry is reported to be above 120 billion which further indicates its projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of more than 5.8% from 2023 to 2030.
