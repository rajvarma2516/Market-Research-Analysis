The increasing prevalence of cancer worldwide, coupled with the demand for non-invasive diagnostic procedures, is driving the market growth. Liquid biopsies provide a more accessible and less invasive alternative to traditional tissue biopsies, leading to their increased adoption in early cancer detection, monitoring treatment responses, and detecting recurrence. Advancements in technology, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the integration of AI in diagnostic tools, further boost the market's potential.Emerging markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin America present significant growth opportunities due to rising healthcare infrastructure, increased awareness about cancer screening, and expanding access to advanced diagnostic solutions. The market's expansion is also supported by favorable government initiatives to combat cancer and growing investment in research and development. By 2030, the tumor blood testing market is expected to surpass USD 25 billion, driven by the increasing application of these tests across various cancer types, such as lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Key factors such as early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and patient demand for minimally invasive procedures will continue to push the market forward.</p><p class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Global Tumor Blood Testing Report @ <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=248240&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=232" target="_blank">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=248240&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=232</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who are the largest Global manufacturers in the Tumor Blood Testing industry?</h3><p><li>Guardant Health</li><li> Trovagene</li><li> Genomic Health</li><li> Roche</li><li> Bio-Techne</li><li> Pathway Genomics</li></p><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><p>By the year 2030, the scale for growth in the market research industry is reported to be above 120 billion which further indicates its projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of more than 5.8% from 2023 to 2030.
