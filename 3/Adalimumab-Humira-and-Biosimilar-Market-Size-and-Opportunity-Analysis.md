Adalimumab, a leading biologic for autoimmune disorders, has been experiencing significant competition from biosimilars, which have gained traction since the expiration of Humira's patent. The biosimilar market, in particular, has been growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 35% as of 2022. This growth reflects the increasing adoption of biosimilars driven by cost-effectiveness and rising healthcare costs. The market size for biosimilars alone was estimated at around $6.8 billion in 2022.</p> <p>Opportunity analysis reveals substantial potential in emerging markets, where the adoption of biosimilars is expected to accelerate. Emerging economies in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and parts of Africa present significant growth opportunities due to increasing healthcare infrastructure and rising prevalence of autoimmune diseases. The CAGR for the biosimilar segment in these regions is projected to surpass 40% over the next few years, reflecting a robust market potential driven by affordability and improved access to treatment options. The expanding patient base and favorable regulatory environments in these regions further support the promising outlook for both Adalimumab and its biosimilars.</p> </p><p class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Global Adalimumab (Humira) and Biosimilar Report @ <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=876034&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=232" target="_blank">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=876034&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=232</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who are the largest Global manufacturers in the Adalimumab (Humira) and Biosimilar industry?</h3><p><li>AbbVie</li><li> Eisai</li><li> Cadila Healthcare</li><li> Torrent Pharmaceuticals</li><li> Amgen</li><li> Boehringer Ingelheim</li><li> Novartis</li><li> Samsung Bioepis</li><li> Viatris</li><li> Pfizer</li><li> Fresenius Kabi</li><li> Coherus</li></p><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><p>By the year 2030, the scale for growth in the market research industry is reported to be above 120 billion which further indicates its projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of more than 5.8% from 2023 to 2030.
